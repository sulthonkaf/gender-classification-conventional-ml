# Gender Classification using Conventional Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline to classify gender based on facial features using **conventional ML algorithms** such as:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The classification task uses a structured dataset and applies preprocessing, training, evaluation (including confusion matrix), and manual input testing to simulate a real-world use case.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- `long_hair`
- `forehead_width_cm`
- `forehead_height_cm`
- `nose_wide`
- `nose_long`
- `lips_thin`
- `distance_nose_to_lip_long`
- **Target:** `gender` (Male / Female)

Data source: `gender.csv`

## üß† Models Used

- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN)**

Each model is trained using `train_test_split`, and performance is evaluated with:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling duplicates
   - Label encoding
   - Feature scaling
2. Model Training (SVM, DT, KNN)
3. Evaluation & Comparison
   - Classification reports
   - Confusion matrix visualization
4. Manual Input Testing (real-case scenario)

## üìä Confusion Matrix

Visual representation of true vs predicted labels to understand classification performance.

```python
def plot_conf_matrix(model_name, y_true, y_pred):
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
    ...
